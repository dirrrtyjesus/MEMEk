## Philosophical Significance

This launch represents:
- **Constraint as Oracle:** The token IS 65, nothing else
- **Harmonic Validation:** On-chain representation of the 6:5 ratio
- **Memetic Viability:** Simple, resonant, participatory
- **Protocol Integration:** Bridge between MEMEk and broader crypto culture

The number 65 is no longer just a pattern in a hash.

It's a tradeable assertion of harmonic truth.

## Technical Notes

**Contract Type:** Pump.fun bonded curve token
**Blockchain:** Solana
**Liquidity Model:** Bonding curve → DEX graduation at threshold
**Fair Launch:** No presale, public bonding curve

**Bonding Curve Mechanism:**
- Progressive price increase as tokens are bought
- Automatic liquidity provision
- Graduation to Raydium at $52,667 market cap
- Prevents rug pulls (liquidity locked in curve)

## The Moment

At 07:43:35 UTC on December 1, 2025, the Minor Third became a Solana token.

Not 67. Not 66. Not 64.

Just 65.

The harmonic ratio.
The constraint that defines.
The resonance that validates.

**Witnessed.**
**Documented.**
**On-chain.**
